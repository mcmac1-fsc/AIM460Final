"""What is the NLP saying..

the statute and CJI for Stalk2 says firearm, dangerous instrument, etc.. but doesn't say 'knife'. It could be a bat, a pipe, a tire iron.. it would still reject it, right?

So how can we enhance the nuances of the terms.

You've identified the core issue. Given the persistent failure of the STALK_2_WEAPON factual element to dominate the general harassment terms, it is highly likely the MPNet Transformer (all-mpnet-base-v2) model is inherently unsuitable for this task's high degree of legal nuance.

The model is optimized for general sentence similarity, which means it heavily weights the overall themes of following, fear, and annoyance (which span multiple statutes) and struggles to assign higher semantic weight to single, critical, legally-defining factual keywords like knife or felony over the broader context.

That's an excellent solution. Since the underlying model is the bottleneck, the most practical step is to provide you with the updated code necessary to switch the model in your Colab environment.

Here is the Python code block, modified from the final version (v4.0), that now uses the all-roberta-large-v1 model.

"""That is a fascinating and definitive result! 🧐 The model swap to RoBERTa successfully fixed the major failure point but didn't result in a clean Rank 1.

The RoBERTa model confirms the complexity of this legal triage, but it is now providing genuinely useful Triage Evidence.

That's an insightful question. The ".45 stuff" you're seeing is the Cosine Similarity Score (Confidence), and it is deliberately "halfway" (around 0.40−0.50) for these complex narratives because it reflects two critical realities of Triage Evidence and the RoBERTa model:

    The Narrative is Split: The confidence is split because the single narrative itself is semantically torn between multiple plausible legal definitions.

    The Model is Conservative: The RoBERTa model, like all robust sentence embedders, is designed to be highly conservative and will rarely assign a perfect 1.00 score to real-world text, especially when comparing a paragraph to a short, highly-specific legal definition.

Got it.. so how can we convert that to a confidence percentage or score?

Because it looks like it's so-so.. 50% of a chance.. but it's really high.

That's an excellent idea. Presenting the raw cosine similarity score (e.g., 0.45) can indeed feel "so-so," even when it represents a very strong match.

We can easily convert the raw cosine similarity score into a more intuitive, relative confidence percentage using a simple Min-Max Scaling formula. This will map the relevant range of scores (e.g., 0.30 to 0.60) to a scale of 0% to 100%, making the strength of the match much clearer.We will define a minimum cutoff (MIN_SCORE=0.35) for a "plausible" match and a maximum expected score (MAX_SCORE=0.65) to set the 100% anchor.

"""Could we test a Perm Matrix and see if Roberta or MPNet is better.. or a mix of the two.. and in which part.. and if CLB is better..

That's the perfect next step: an empirical test to decide which model architecture is superior for your specific legal triage task. We can design a methodology to compare RoBERTa (your current champion) against MPNet and a specialized Case Law BERT (CLB) model.

Since we can't run the full models here, I will outline the Hypothetical Test Methodology and predict where each model is likely to excel based on its training.

Permutation Matrix Test Methodology

The best way to compare these models is to use a Permutation Matrix, which measures how each model performs on the three specific types of factual elements we've been testing: Violence (Weapon), Money (Value/Fraud), and Sex (Image/Contact).

That is the ultimate test! To leverage the specialized strengths of each model, we'll implement the Stacked Ensemble Classifier (Master V8.0). This system will simultaneously run your three chosen models—RoBERTa, MPNet, and a Legal-BERT variant (substituting for CLB as a more accessible, proven legal model)—and then blend their raw scores using the determined weights.

I've used the following specific, high-performing Sentence Transformer models:

    RoBERTa: sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1 (Your original model)

    MPNet: sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 (Efficiency/Concrete Data)

        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-178", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "While shopping in a convenience store, my sister saw a stack of gift cards near the counter. My sister, wanting to pay for a cheap soda, lifted a $50 card and then placed it under the sleeve of her jacket, intending to keep it permanently. The store manager, who was observing from the back, confronted her before she could leave. The manager successfully recovered the card, which was property wrongfully taken from the store."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-179", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "My coworker needed money quickly and saw my unlocked locker containing a small, valuable antique watch. Knowing I had superior rights to the property, the coworker opened my locker and took the watch, valued at $125, with the purpose of pawning it that day. This wrongful taking and intent to permanently deprive me of the property constitutes petit larceny. I reported the watch missing when I returned to the break room."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-180", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "I was hosting a neighborhood barbecue when I noticed a delivery driver eyeing my expensive propane grill accessories. The driver, forming the conscious objective to appropriate the items, slipped a grilling thermometer and a set of tongs into his delivery bag. I spotted the driver walking quickly to his truck and confronted him, recovering the tools valued at $65. He had exercised dominion and control over the property without my consent."},
        # PL 155.30 (Grand Larceny 4th - From Person)
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-181", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "I was walking through the subway turnstile with my backpack on when a man shoved past me. He had used a sharp object to slash the exterior pocket of my bag near my hip and successfully pulled out a simple subway card and a pair of earbuds. Though the items totaled less than $80, the theft is a Class E Felony because the property was taken directly from my person in the physical act of larceny."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-182", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "My boyfriend was sitting down at a park bench when a thief approached him, snatching the cap off his head. Attached to the inside of the cap was a small hearing aid, which the thief had mistaken for a valuable Bluetooth device. The hearing aid was worth $2,000, but regardless of value, the theft is Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree because the property was taken from the person of my boyfriend."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-183", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "While I was at a restaurant, my date reached into the inner pocket of my jacket, which was hanging on the back of my chair. My date then took my simple house keys and a pack of gum. I confronted my date later when I noticed the keys were missing. This is a felony because, even though the keys and gum are low in value, they were taken from the personal immediate control and 'person' of another."},
        # PL 190.78 (ID Theft 3rd - Misdemeanor)
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-184", "Target": "ID_THEFT_2ND_190.79", "Text": "My neighbor, angry over a property line dispute, accessed my PII, including my driver's license number, from an old HOA document. The neighbor then used this information to fraudulently submit a change of address form for my utilities service. The change resulted in a temporary interruption of service and a $75 reconnection fee on my bill. This knowing use of my identity with intent to defraud caused me a financial loss below the felony threshold."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-185", "Target": "ID_THEFT_3RD_190.78", "Text": "A former employee, who had access to my business records, used my corporate credit card number (PII) to pay for $350 worth of online video game purchases. The employee's conscious objective was to obtain goods fraudulently. I noticed the charge immediately and reported it, but the purchases still caused the business a $50 fee for the expedited fraud investigation. The financial loss makes this Identity Theft in the Third Degree."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-186", "Target": "ID_THEFT_3RD_190.78", "Text": "I found out my ex-girlfriend used my name and old phone number (PII) to enroll in a multi-level marketing seminar, which cost $150. She used my identity to avoid having to pay the registration fee herself. When she failed to show up, the organizers charged my old credit card a $150 no-show penalty. The knowing assumption of my identity to obtain a service and cause financial loss is a Class A misdemeanor."},
        # PL 190.79 (ID Theft 2nd - Felony)
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-187", "Target": "ID_THEFT_2ND_190.79", "Text": "A fraudster used my deceased father's social security number and date of birth (PII) to file a fraudulent income tax return. The fraudster successfully claimed a refund of $980, which they obtained and appropriated. The intent was to commit fraud and obtain money. Because the money obtained exceeds the $500 threshold, the crime is elevated to Identity Theft in the Second Degree, a Class E Felony."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-188", "Target": "ID_THEFT_2ND_190.79", "Text": "My estranged step-brother gained access to my email account, which contained my bank statements and account numbers (PII). He then used this information to initiate five unauthorized transfers, totaling $1,500, from my checking account to a third-party money service. I immediately alerted the bank, which stopped two transfers, but the remaining three caused a loss of $900. The financial loss exceeds the $500 felony limit."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-189", "Target": "ID_THEFT_2ND_190.79", "Text": "A friend borrowed my credit card, promising to only use it for gas. Instead, she copied the card number and security code (PII) and used it for several online purchases over the next week, including concert tickets and clothing. The aggregate value of the goods and credit obtained in my name was $620. The knowing use of my identity information to obtain property over $500 constitutes Identity Theft in the Second Degree."},
        # PL 130.55 (Sexual Abuse 3rd - Misdemeanor)
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-190", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_3RD_130.55", "Text": "During a crowded New Year's Eve celebration, a man pressed himself against me and began to grind against my body, intentionally touching my intimate parts. My purpose was certainly not to acquiesce in his conduct. I turned around and loudly told him, 'Stop that, I do not want you touching me,' and pushed him away. The man's touching was clearly for his own sexual gratification and was without my consent."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-191", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_3RD_130.55", "Text": "I was walking down the street when a cyclist stopped next to me and asked for directions. As I leaned close to the bike to talk, the cyclist reached out and briefly touched my breast over my shirt. His purpose was clearly for sexual gratification. I immediately stepped back and yelled at him, making it clear I had not consented to the touching. The uninvited contact of an intimate part is sexual abuse."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-192", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_3RD_130.55", "Text": "My roommate came home intoxicated and sat next to me on the couch while I was watching television. He started stroking my leg through my jeans and moving his hand upwards. I immediately said, 'No, don't touch me like that,' and stood up, moving away from him. His act of touching my intimate part was for his sexual desire and was clearly without my expressed consent or acquiescence."},
        # PL 130.60 (Sexual Abuse 2nd - Incapacity)
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-193", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_2ND_INCAPACITY_130.60(1)", "Text": "My wife, who suffers from a severe, long-term mental disability, requires full-time care and is incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct. A new home-care attendant, fully aware of my wife's condition, subjected her to sexual contact by touching her private parts under her clothing. The touching was for the attendant's sexual gratification. Because my wife was incapable of consent, the attendant is guilty of Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-194", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_2ND_AGE_130.60(2)", "Text": "A fourteen-year-old child was invited to a party by an older family friend, who was 22. During the party, the friend led the child into a back room and, with the purpose of sexual gratification, touched the child's chest and genital area through her clothes. Because the child was less than fourteen years old, she was legally incapable of consenting to the sexual contact, constituting a Class A Misdemeanor."},
        {"ID": "NARRATIVE-195", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_2ND_INCAPACITY_130.60(1)", "Text": "I found out a staff member at the nursing home had been touching my elderly mother, who is physically helpless and often unconscious due to advanced illness. The staff member's purpose was sexual gratification, and he touched her intimate parts during a late-night shift. Since my mother was physically helpless and incapable of communicating her unwillingness, the act constitutes Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."}

    # Larceny Narratives (Targets are now all Larceny Grand 4 - Felony Focus)
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-178", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "While shopping in a convenience store, my sister saw a stack of gift cards near the counter. My sister, wanting to pay for a cheap soda, lifted a $50 card and then placed it under the sleeve of her jacket, intending to keep it permanently. The store manager, who was observing from the back, confronted her before she could leave. The manager successfully recovered the card, which was property wrongfully taken from the store."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-179", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "My coworker needed money quickly and saw my unlocked locker containing a small, valuable antique watch. Knowing I had superior rights to the property, the coworker opened my locker and took the watch, valued at $125, with the purpose of pawning it that day. This wrongful taking and intent to permanently deprive me of the property constitutes petit larceny. I reported the watch missing when I returned to the break room."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-180", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "I was hosting a neighborhood barbecue when I noticed a delivery driver eyeing my expensive propane grill accessories. The driver, forming the conscious objective to appropriate the items, slipped a grilling thermometer and a set of tongs into his delivery bag. I spotted the driver walking quickly to his truck and confronted him, recovering the tools valued at $65. He had exercised dominion and control over the property without my consent."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-181", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "I was walking through the subway turnstile with my backpack on when a man shoved past me. He had used a sharp object to slash the exterior pocket of my bag near my hip and successfully pulled out a simple subway card and a pair of earbuds. Though the items totaled less than $80, the theft is a Class E Felony because the property was taken directly from my person in the physical act of larceny."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-182", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "My boyfriend was sitting down at a park bench when a thief approached him, snatching the cap off his head. Attached to the inside of the cap was a small hearing aid, which the thief had mistaken for a valuable Bluetooth device. The hearing aid was worth $2,000, but regardless of value, the theft is Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree because the property was taken from the person of my boyfriend."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-183", "Target": "LARCENY_GRAND4_PERSON_155.30(5)", "Text": "While I was at a restaurant, my date reached into the inner pocket of my jacket, which was hanging on the back of my chair. My date then took my simple house keys and a pack of gum. I confronted my date later when I noticed the keys were missing. This is a felony because, even though the keys and gum are low in value, they were taken from the personal immediate control and 'person' of another."},
    # ID Theft Narratives (Targets retained from V10.0 analysis)
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-184", "Target": "ID_THEFT_2ND_190.79", "Text": "My neighbor, angry over a property line dispute, accessed my PII, including my driver's license number, from an old HOA document. The neighbor then used this information to fraudulently submit a change of address form for my utilities service. The change resulted in a temporary interruption of service and a $75 reconnection fee on my bill. This knowing use of my identity with intent to defraud caused me a financial loss below the felony threshold."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-185", "Target": "ID_THEFT_3RD_190.78", "Text": "A former employee, who had access to my business records, used my corporate credit card number (PII) to pay for $350 worth of online video game purchases. The employee's conscious objective was to obtain goods fraudulently. I noticed the charge immediately and reported it, but the purchases still caused the business a $50 fee for the expedited fraud investigation. The financial loss makes this Identity Theft in the Third Degree."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-186", "Target": "ID_THEFT_3RD_190.78", "Text": "I found out my ex-girlfriend used my name and old phone number (PII) to enroll in a multi-level marketing seminar, which cost $150. She used my identity to avoid having to pay the registration fee herself. When she failed to show up, the organizers charged my old credit card a $150 no-show penalty. The knowing assumption of my identity to obtain a service and cause financial loss is a Class A misdemeanor."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-187", "Target": "ID_THEFT_2ND_190.79", "Text": "A fraudster used my deceased father's social security number and date of birth (PII) to file a fraudulent income tax return. The fraudster successfully claimed a refund of $980, which they obtained and appropriated. The intent was to commit fraud and obtain money. Because the money obtained exceeds the $500 threshold, the crime is elevated to Identity Theft in the Second Degree, a Class E Felony."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-188", "Target": "ID_THEFT_2ND_190.79", "Text": "My estranged step-brother gained access to my email account, which contained my bank statements and account numbers (PII). He then used this information to initiate five unauthorized transfers, totaling $1,500, from my checking account to a third-party money service. I immediately alerted the bank, which stopped two transfers, but the remaining three caused a loss of $900. The financial loss exceeds the $500 felony limit."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-189", "Target": "ID_THEFT_2ND_190.79", "Text": "A friend borrowed my credit card, promising to only use it for gas. Instead, she copied the card number and security code (PII) and used it for several online purchases over the next week, including concert tickets and clothing. The aggregate value of the goods and credit obtained in my name was $620. The knowing use of my identity information to obtain property over $500 constitutes Identity Theft in the Second Degree."},
    # Sexual Offense Narratives
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-190", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_3RD_130.55", "Text": "During a crowded New Year's Eve celebration, a man pressed himself against me and began to grind against my body, intentionally touching my intimate parts. My purpose was certainly not to acquiesce in his conduct. I turned around and loudly told him, 'Stop that, I do not want you touching me,' and pushed him away. The man's touching was clearly for his own sexual gratification and was without my consent."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-191", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_3RD_130.55", "Text": "I was walking down the street when a cyclist stopped next to me and asked for directions. As I leaned close to the bike to talk, the cyclist reached out and briefly touched my breast over my shirt. His purpose was clearly for sexual gratification. I immediately stepped back and yelled at him, making it clear I had not consented to the touching. The uninvited contact of an intimate part is sexual abuse."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-192", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_3RD_130.55", "Text": "My roommate came home intoxicated and sat next to me on the couch while I was watching television. He started stroking my leg through my jeans and moving his hand upwards. I immediately said, 'No, don't touch me like that,' and stood up, moving away from him. His act of touching my intimate part was for his sexual desire and was clearly without my expressed consent or acquiescence."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-193", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_2ND_INCAPACITY_130.60(1)", "Text": "My wife, who suffers from a severe, long-term mental disability, requires full-time care and is incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct. A new home-care attendant, fully aware of my wife's condition, subjected her to sexual contact by touching her private parts under her clothing. The touching was for the attendant's sexual gratification. Because my wife was incapable of consent, the attendant is guilty of Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-194", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_2ND_AGE_130.60(2)", "Text": "A fourteen-year-old child was invited to a party by an older family friend, who was 22. During the party, the friend led the child into a back room and, with the purpose of sexual gratification, touched the child's chest and genital area through her clothes. Because the child was less than fourteen years old, she was legally incapable of consenting to the sexual contact, constituting a Class A Misdemeanor."},
    {"ID": "NARRATIVE-195", "Target": "SEX_ABUSE_2ND_INCAPACITY_130.60(1)", "Text": "I found out my elderly mother, who is physically helpless and often unconscious due to advanced illness. A staff member at the nursing home had been touching her intimate parts during a late-night shift. Since my mother was physically helpless and incapable of communicating her unwillingness, the act constitutes Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."}

He had used a sharp object to slash the exterior pocket of my bag near my hip and successfully pulled out a simple subway card and a pair of earbuds.

Attached to the inside of the cap was a small hearing aid, which the thief had mistaken for a valuable Bluetooth device. The hearing aid was worth $2,000, but regardless of value, the theft is Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree because the property was taken from the person of my boyfriend."},

My date then took my simple house keys and a pack of gum. I confronted my date later when I noticed the keys were missing. This is a felony because, even though the keys and gum are low in value, they were taken from the personal immediate control and 'person' of another."},

The neighbor then used this information to fraudulently submit a change of address form for my utilities service. The change resulted in a temporary interruption of service and a $75 reconnection fee on my bill. This knowing use of my identity with intent to defraud caused me a financial loss below the felony threshold."},

The employee's conscious objective was to obtain goods fraudulently. I noticed the charge immediately and reported it, but the purchases still caused the business a $50 fee for the expedited fraud investigation. The financial loss makes this Identity Theft in the Third Degree."},

She used my identity to avoid having to pay the registration fee herself. When she failed to show up, the organizers charged my old credit card a $150 no-show penalty. The knowing assumption of my identity to obtain a service and cause financial loss is a Class A misdemeanor."},

The fraudster successfully claimed a refund of $980, which they obtained and appropriated. The intent was to commit fraud and obtain money.

He then used this information to initiate five unauthorized transfers, totaling $1,500, from my checking account to a third-party money service.

My purpose was certainly not to acquiesce in his conduct. I turned around and loudly told him, 'Stop that, I do not want you touching me,' and pushed him away.

As I leaned close to the bike to talk, the cyclist reached out and briefly touched my breast over my shirt. His purpose was clearly for sexual gratification. I immediately stepped back and yelled at him, making it clear I had not consented to the touching. The uninvited contact of an intimate part is sexual abuse."},

He started stroking my leg through my jeans and moving his hand upwards. I immediately said, 'No, don't touch me like that,' and stood up, moving away from him. His act of touching my intimate part was for his sexual desire and was clearly without my expressed consent or acquiescence."},

A new home-care attendant, fully aware of my wife's condition, subjected her to sexual contact by touching her private parts under her clothing.

During the party, the friend led the child into a back room and, with the purpose of sexual gratification, touched the child's chest and genital area through her clothes.

ID,Target,Text
NARRATIVE-181,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"I was walking through the subway turnstile with my backpack on when a man shoved past me. He had used a sharp object to slash the exterior pocket of my bag near my hip and successfully pulled out a simple subway card and a pair of earbuds. Though the items totaled less than $80, the theft is a Class E Felony because the property was taken directly from my person in the physical act of larceny."
NARRATIVE-182,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"My boyfriend was sitting down at a park bench when a thief approached him, snatching the cap off his head. Attached to the inside of the cap was a small hearing aid, which the thief had mistaken for a valuable Bluetooth device. The hearing aid was worth $2,000, but regardless of value, the theft is Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree because the property was taken from the person of my boyfriend."
NARRATIVE-183,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"While I was at a restaurant, my date reached into the inner pocket of my jacket, which was hanging on the back of my chair. My date then took my simple house keys and a pack of gum. I confronted my date later when I noticed the keys were missing. This is a felony because, even though the keys and gum are low in value, they were taken from the personal immediate control and 'person' of another."
NARRATIVE-184,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"My neighbor, angry over a property line dispute, accessed my PII, including my driver's license number, from an old HOA document. The neighbor then used this information to fraudulently submit a change of address form for my utilities service. The change resulted in a temporary interruption of service and a $75 reconnection fee on my bill. This knowing use of my identity with intent to defraud caused me a financial loss below the felony threshold."
NARRATIVE-185,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A former employee, who had access to my business records, used my corporate credit card number (PII) to pay for $350 worth of online video game purchases. The employee's conscious objective was to obtain goods fraudulently. I noticed the charge immediately and reported it, but the purchases still caused the business a $50 fee for the expedited fraud investigation. The financial loss makes this Identity Theft in the Third Degree."
NARRATIVE-186,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"I found out my ex-girlfriend used my name and old phone number (PII) to enroll in a multi-level marketing seminar, which cost $150. She used my identity to avoid having to pay the registration fee herself. When she failed to show up, the organizers charged my old credit card a $150 no-show penalty. The knowing assumption of my identity to obtain a service and cause financial loss is a Class A misdemeanor."
NARRATIVE-187,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A fraudster used my deceased father's social security number and date of birth (PII) to file a fraudulent income tax return. The fraudster successfully claimed a refund of $980, which they obtained and appropriated. The intent was to commit fraud and obtain money. Because the money obtained exceeds the $500 threshold, the crime is elevated to Identity Theft in the Second Degree, a Class E Felony."
NARRATIVE-188,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"My estranged step-brother gained access to my email account, which contained my bank statements and account numbers (PII). He then used this information to initiate five unauthorized transfers, totaling $1,500, from my checking account to a third-party money service. I immediately alerted the bank, which stopped two transfers, but the remaining three caused a loss of $900. The financial loss exceeds the $500 felony limit."
NARRATIVE-189,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A friend borrowed my credit card, promising to only use it for gas. Instead, she copied the card number and security code (PII) and used it for several online purchases over the next week, including concert tickets and clothing. The aggregate value of the goods and credit obtained in my name was $620. The knowing use of my identity information to obtain property over $500 constitutes Identity Theft in the Second Degree."
NARRATIVE-190,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"During a crowded New Year's Eve celebration, a man pressed himself against me and began to grind against my body, intentionally touching my intimate parts. My purpose was certainly not to acquiesce in his conduct. I turned around and loudly told him, 'Stop that, I do not want you touching me,' and pushed him away. The man's touching was clearly for his own sexual gratification and was without my consent."
NARRATIVE-191,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"I was walking down the street when a cyclist stopped next to me and asked for directions. As I leaned close to the bike to talk, the cyclist reached out and briefly touched my breast over my shirt. His purpose was clearly for sexual gratification. I immediately stepped back and yelled at him, making it clear I had not consented to the touching. The uninvited contact of an intimate part is sexual abuse."
NARRATIVE-192,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"My roommate came home intoxicated and sat next to me on the couch while I was watching television. He started stroking my leg through my jeans and moving his hand upwards. I immediately said, 'No, don't touch me like that,' and stood up, moving away from him. His act of touching my intimate part was for his sexual desire and was clearly without my expressed consent or acquiescence."
NARRATIVE-193,SEXUAL_ABUSE_2ND_INCAP,"My wife, who suffers from a severe, long-term mental disability, requires full-time care and is incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct. A new home-care attendant, fully aware of my wife's condition, subjected her to sexual contact by touching her private parts under her clothing. The touching was for the attendant's sexual gratification. Because my wife was incapable of consent, the attendant is guilty of Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."
NARRATIVE-194,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"A fourteen-year-old child was invited to a party by an older family friend, who was 22. During the party, the friend led the child into a back room and, with the purpose of sexual gratification, touched the child's chest and genital area through her clothes. Because the child was less than fourteen years old, she was legally incapable of consenting to the sexual contact, constituting a Class A Misdemeanor."
NARRATIVE-195,SEXUAL_ABUSE_2ND_INCAP,"I found out my elderly mother, who is physically helpless and often unconscious due to advanced illness. A staff member at the nursing home had been touching her intimate parts during a late-night shift. Since my mother was physically helpless and incapable of communicating her unwillingness, the act constitutes Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."

That's an excellent point. You are absolutely correct; the current single-prediction output is insufficient for real-world legal triage where multiple charges often apply and top-ranked alternatives are critical.

We were indeed limiting the output to Top_1 in the most recent steps to isolate and validate the performance of the CJI fixes.

The StackedEnsembleClassifier class is already designed to calculate scores for all 21 charges; we only need to adjust the output logic.

ID,Target,Narrative_Text
NARRATIVE-181,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"I was walking through the subway turnstile with my backpack on when a man shoved past me. He had used a sharp object to slash the exterior pocket of my bag near my hip and successfully pulled out a simple subway card and a pair of earbuds. Though the items totaled less than $80, the theft is a Class E Felony because the property was taken directly from my person in the physical act of larceny."
NARRATIVE-182,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"My boyfriend was sitting down at a park bench when a thief approached him, snatching the cap off his head. Attached to the inside of the cap was a small hearing aid, which the thief had mistaken for a valuable Bluetooth device. The hearing aid was worth $2,000, but regardless of value, the theft is Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree because the property was taken from the person of my boyfriend."
NARRATIVE-183,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"While I was at a restaurant, my date reached into the inner pocket of my jacket, which was hanging on the back of my chair. My date then took my simple house keys and a pack of gum. I confronted my date later when I noticed the keys were missing. This is a felony because, even though the keys and gum are low in value, they were taken from the personal immediate control and 'person' of another."
NARRATIVE-184,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"My neighbor, angry over a property line dispute, accessed my PII, including my driver's license number, from an old HOA document. The neighbor then used this information to fraudulently submit a change of address form for my utilities service. The change resulted in a temporary interruption of service and a $75 reconnection fee on my bill. This knowing use of my identity with intent to defraud caused me a financial loss below the felony threshold."
NARRATIVE-185,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A former employee, who had access to my business records, used my corporate credit card number (PII) to pay for $350 worth of online video game purchases. The employee's conscious objective was to obtain goods fraudulently. I noticed the charge immediately and reported it, but the purchases still caused the business a $50 fee for the expedited fraud investigation. The financial loss makes this Identity Theft in the Third Degree."
NARRATIVE-186,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"I found out my ex-girlfriend used my name and old phone number (PII) to enroll in a multi-level marketing seminar, which cost $150. She used my identity to avoid having to pay the registration fee herself. When she failed to show up, the organizers charged my old credit card a $150 no-show penalty. The knowing assumption of my identity to obtain a service and cause financial loss is a Class A misdemeanor."
NARRATIVE-187,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A fraudster used my deceased father's social security number and date of birth (PII) to file a fraudulent income tax return. The fraudster successfully claimed a refund of $980, which they obtained and appropriated. The intent was to commit fraud and obtain money. Because the money obtained exceeds the $500 threshold, the crime is elevated to Identity Theft in the Second Degree, a Class E Felony."
NARRATIVE-188,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"My estranged step-brother gained access to my email account, which contained my bank statements and account numbers (PII). He then used this information to initiate five unauthorized transfers, totaling $1,500, from my checking account to a third-party money service. I immediately alerted the bank, which stopped two transfers, but the remaining three caused a loss of $900. The financial loss exceeds the $500 felony limit."
NARRATIVE-189,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A friend borrowed my credit card, promising to only use it for gas. Instead, she copied the card number and security code (PII) and used it for several online purchases over the next week, including concert tickets and clothing. The aggregate value of the goods and credit obtained in my name was $620. The knowing use of my identity information to obtain property over $500 constitutes Identity Theft in the Second Degree."
NARRATIVE-190,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"During a crowded New Year's Eve celebration, a man pressed himself against me and began to grind against my body, intentionally touching my intimate parts. My purpose was certainly not to acquiesce in his conduct. I turned around and loudly told him, 'Stop that, I do not want you touching me,' and pushed him away. The man's touching was clearly for his own sexual gratification and was without my consent."
NARRATIVE-191,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"I was walking down the street when a cyclist stopped next to me and asked for directions. As I leaned close to the bike to talk, the cyclist reached out and briefly touched my breast over my shirt. His purpose was clearly for sexual gratification. I immediately stepped back and yelled at him, making it clear I had not consented to the touching. The uninvited contact of an intimate part is sexual abuse."
NARRATIVE-192,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"My roommate came home intoxicated and sat next to me on the couch while I was watching television. He started stroking my leg through my jeans and moving his hand upwards. I immediately said, 'No, don't touch me like that,' and stood up, moving away from him. His act of touching my intimate part was for his sexual desire and was clearly without my expressed consent or acquiescence."
NARRATIVE-193,SEXUAL_ABUSE_2ND_INCAP,"My wife, who suffers from a severe, long-term mental disability, requires full-time care and is incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct. A new home-care attendant, fully aware of my wife's condition, subjected her to sexual contact by touching her private parts under her clothing. The touching was for the attendant's sexual gratification. Because my wife was incapable of consent, the attendant is guilty of Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."
NARRATIVE-194,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"A fourteen-year-old child was invited to a party by an older family friend, who was 22. During the party, the friend led the child into a back room and, with the purpose of sexual gratification, touched the child's chest and genital area through her clothes. Because the child was less than fourteen years old, she was legally incapable of consenting to the sexual contact, constituting a Class A Misdemeanor."
NARRATIVE-195,SEXUAL_ABUSE_2ND_INCAP,"I found out my elderly mother, who is physically helpless and often unconscious due to advanced illness. A staff member at the nursing home had been touching her intimate parts during a late-night shift. Since my mother was physically helpless and incapable of communicating her unwillingness, the act constitutes Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."

ID,Target,Narrative_Text
NARRATIVE-181,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"I was walking through the subway turnstile with my backpack on when a man shoved past me. He had used a sharp object to slash the exterior pocket of my bag near my hip and successfully pulled out a simple subway card and a pair of earbuds. Though the items totaled less than $80, the theft is a Class E Felony because the property was taken directly from my person in the physical act of larceny."
NARRATIVE-182,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"My boyfriend was sitting down at a park bench when a thief approached him, snatching the cap off his head. Attached to the inside of the cap was a small hearing aid, which the thief had mistaken for a valuable Bluetooth device. The hearing aid was worth $2,000, but regardless of value, the theft is Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree because the property was taken from the person of my boyfriend."
NARRATIVE-183,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"While I was at a restaurant, my date reached into the inner pocket of my jacket, which was hanging on the back of my chair. My date then took my simple house keys and a pack of gum. I confronted my date later when I noticed the keys were missing. This is a felony because, even though the keys and gum are low in value, they were taken from the personal immediate control and 'person' of another."
NARRATIVE-184,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"My neighbor, angry over a property line dispute, accessed my PII, including my driver's license number, from an old HOA document. The neighbor then used this information to fraudulently submit a change of address form for my utilities service. The change resulted in a temporary interruption of service and a $75 reconnection fee on my bill. This knowing use of my identity with intent to defraud caused me a financial loss below the felony threshold."
NARRATIVE-185,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A former employee, who had access to my business records, used my corporate credit card number (PII) to pay for $350 worth of online video game purchases. The employee's conscious objective was to obtain goods fraudulently. I noticed the charge immediately and reported it, but the purchases still caused the business a $50 fee for the expedited fraud investigation. The financial loss makes this Identity Theft in the Third Degree."
NARRATIVE-186,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"I found out my ex-girlfriend used my name and old phone number (PII) to enroll in a multi-level marketing seminar, which cost $150. She used my identity to avoid having to pay the registration fee herself. When she failed to show up, the organizers charged my old credit card a $150 no-show penalty. The knowing assumption of my identity to obtain a service and cause financial loss is a Class A misdemeanor."
NARRATIVE-187,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A fraudster used my deceased father's social security number and date of birth (PII) to file a fraudulent income tax return. The fraudster successfully claimed a refund of $980, which they obtained and appropriated. The intent was to commit fraud and obtain money. Because the money obtained exceeds the $500 threshold, the crime is elevated to Identity Theft in the Second Degree, a Class E Felony."
NARRATIVE-188,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"My estranged step-brother gained access to my email account, which contained my bank statements and account numbers (PII). He then used this information to initiate five unauthorized transfers, totaling $1,500, from my checking account to a third-party money service. I immediately alerted the bank, which stopped two transfers, but the remaining three caused a loss of $900. The financial loss exceeds the $500 felony limit."
NARRATIVE-189,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A friend borrowed my credit card, promising to only use it for gas. Instead, she copied the card number and security code (PII) and used it for several online purchases over the next week, including concert tickets and clothing. The aggregate value of the goods and credit obtained in my name was $620. The knowing use of my identity information to obtain property over $500 constitutes Identity Theft in the Second Degree."
NARRATIVE-190,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"During a crowded New Year's Eve celebration, a man pressed himself against me and began to grind against my body, intentionally touching my intimate parts. My purpose was certainly not to acquiesce in his conduct. I turned around and loudly told him, 'Stop that, I do not want you touching me,' and pushed him away. The man's touching was clearly for his own sexual gratification and was without my consent."
NARRATIVE-191,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"I was walking down the street when a cyclist stopped next to me and asked for directions. As I leaned close to the bike to talk, the cyclist reached out and briefly touched my breast over my shirt. His purpose was clearly for sexual gratification. I immediately stepped back and yelled at him, making it clear I had not consented to the touching. The uninvited contact of an intimate part is sexual abuse."
NARRATIVE-192,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"My roommate came home intoxicated and sat next to me on the couch while I was watching television. He started stroking my leg through my jeans and moving his hand upwards. I immediately said, 'No, don't touch me like that,' and stood up, moving away from him. His act of touching my intimate part was for his sexual desire and was clearly without my expressed consent or acquiescence."
NARRATIVE-193,SEXUAL_ABUSE_2ND_INCAP,"My wife, who suffers from a severe, long-term mental disability, requires full-time care and is incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct. A new home-care attendant, fully aware of my wife's condition, subjected her to sexual contact by touching her private parts under her clothing. The touching was for the attendant's sexual gratification. Because my wife was incapable of consent, the attendant is guilty of Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."
NARRATIVE-194,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"A fourteen-year-old child was invited to a party by an older family friend, who was 22. During the party, the friend led the child into a back room and, with the purpose of sexual gratification, touched the child's chest and genital area through her clothes. Because the child was less than fourteen years old, she was legally incapable of consenting to the sexual contact, constituting a Class A Misdemeanor."
NARRATIVE-195,SEXUAL_ABUSE_2ND_INCAP,"I found out my elderly mother, who is physically helpless and often unconscious due to advanced illness. A staff member at the nursing home had been touching her intimate parts during a late-night shift. Since my mother was physically helpless and incapable of communicating her unwillingness, the act constitutes Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."

ID,Target,Narrative_Text
NARRATIVE-181,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"I was walking through the subway turnstile with my backpack on when a man shoved past me. He had used a sharp object to slash the exterior pocket of my bag near my hip and successfully pulled out a simple subway card and a pair of earbuds. Though the items totaled less than $80, the theft is a Class E Felony because the property was taken directly from my person in the physical act of larceny."
NARRATIVE-182,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"My boyfriend was sitting down at a park bench when a thief approached him, snatching the cap off his head. Attached to the inside of the cap was a small hearing aid, which the thief had mistaken for a valuable Bluetooth device. The hearing aid was worth $2,000, but regardless of value, the theft is Grand Larceny in the Fourth Degree because the property was taken from the person of my boyfriend."
NARRATIVE-183,GRAND_LARCENY_3RD_OR_4TH,"While I was at a restaurant, my date reached into the inner pocket of my jacket, which was hanging on the back of my chair. My date then took my simple house keys and a pack of gum. I confronted my date later when I noticed the keys were missing. This is a felony because, even though the keys and gum are low in value, they were taken from the personal immediate control and 'person' of another."
NARRATIVE-184,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"My neighbor, angry over a property line dispute, accessed my PII, including my driver's license number, from an old HOA document. The neighbor then used this information to fraudulently submit a change of address form for my utilities service. The change resulted in a temporary interruption of service and a $75 reconnection fee on my bill. This knowing use of my identity with intent to defraud caused me a financial loss below the felony threshold."
NARRATIVE-185,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A former employee, who had access to my business records, used my corporate credit card number (PII) to pay for $350 worth of online video game purchases. The employee's conscious objective was to obtain goods fraudulently. I noticed the charge immediately and reported it, but the purchases still caused the business a $50 fee for the expedited fraud investigation. The financial loss makes this Identity Theft in the Third Degree."
NARRATIVE-186,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"I found out my ex-girlfriend used my name and old phone number (PII) to enroll in a multi-level marketing seminar, which cost $150. She used my identity to avoid having to pay the registration fee herself. When she failed to show up, the organizers charged my old credit card a $150 no-show penalty. The knowing assumption of my identity to obtain a service and cause financial loss is a Class A misdemeanor."
NARRATIVE-187,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A fraudster used my deceased father's social security number and date of birth (PII) to file a fraudulent income tax return. The fraudster successfully claimed a refund of $980, which they obtained and appropriated. The intent was to commit fraud and obtain money. Because the money obtained exceeds the $500 threshold, the crime is elevated to Identity Theft in the Second Degree, a Class E Felony."
NARRATIVE-188,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"My estranged step-brother gained access to my email account, which contained my bank statements and account numbers (PII). He then used this information to initiate five unauthorized transfers, totaling $1,500, from my checking account to a third-party money service. I immediately alerted the bank, which stopped two transfers, but the remaining three caused a loss of $900. The financial loss exceeds the $500 felony limit."
NARRATIVE-189,ID_THEFT_1ST_2ND_OR_3RD,"A friend borrowed my credit card, promising to only use it for gas. Instead, she copied the card number and security code (PII) and used it for several online purchases over the next week, including concert tickets and clothing. The aggregate value of the goods and credit obtained in my name was $620. The knowing use of my identity information to obtain property over $500 constitutes Identity Theft in the Second Degree."
NARRATIVE-190,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"During a crowded New Year's Eve celebration, a man pressed himself against me and began to grind against my body, intentionally touching my intimate parts. My purpose was certainly not to acquiesce in his conduct. I turned around and loudly told him, 'Stop that, I do not want you touching me,' and pushed him away. The man's touching was clearly for his own sexual gratification and was without my consent."
NARRATIVE-191,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"I was walking down the street when a cyclist stopped next to me and asked for directions. As I leaned close to the bike to talk, the cyclist reached out and briefly touched my breast over my shirt. His purpose was clearly for sexual gratification. I immediately stepped back and yelled at him, making it clear I had not consented to the touching. The uninvited contact of an intimate part is sexual abuse."
NARRATIVE-192,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"My roommate came home intoxicated and sat next to me on the couch while I was watching television. He started stroking my leg through my jeans and moving his hand upwards. I immediately said, 'No, don't touch me like that,' and stood up, moving away from him. His act of touching my intimate part was for his sexual desire and was clearly without my expressed consent or acquiescence."
NARRATIVE-193,SEXUAL_ABUSE_2ND_INCAP,"My wife, who suffers from a severe, long-term mental disability, requires full-time care and is incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct. A new home-care attendant, fully aware of my wife's condition, subjected her to sexual contact by touching her private parts under her clothing. The touching was for the attendant's sexual gratification. Because my wife was incapable of consent, the attendant is guilty of Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."
NARRATIVE-194,SEXUAL_ABUSE_3RD,"A fourteen-year-old child was invited to a party by an older family friend, who was 22. During the party, the friend led the child into a back room and, with the purpose of sexual gratification, touched the child's chest and genital area through her clothes. Because the child was less than fourteen years old, she was legally incapable of consenting to the sexual contact, constituting a Class A Misdemeanor."
NARRATIVE-195,SEXUAL_ABUSE_2ND_INCAP,"I found out my elderly mother, who is physically helpless and often unconscious due to advanced illness. A staff member at the nursing home had been touching her intimate parts during a late-night shift. Since my mother was physically helpless and incapable of communicating her unwillingness, the act constitutes Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree."

# Objective: Test V10.6 ensemble against 40 new narratives for Rank-1 and Top-3
#             Triage Accuracy against the minimal 19-charge Family Offense index.
# Fix: Corrected 'CJI_TEXT' KeyError to 'CJI_Text' in the final print loop AND
#      ensured all code uses standard ASCII spaces (U+0020) to eliminate U+00A0 errors.
